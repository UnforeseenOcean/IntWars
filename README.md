IntWars
==================
**DISCLAIMER: This repo died! Its too hard to keep Visual Studio support with all that not supported C++11 functions. Tell MS to fully support C++11 and we will keep the Visual Studio support. For now, keep a look at Elyotna's repo (https://github.com/Elyotna/IntWars). Its the most up to date repo and the one with most support.**

Notes for Compiling on Windows
---------
Note: This is a very basic explanation. I am working on a more detailed explanation, but don't have the time right now.

This project uses elements from C++11, like initialization lists. Visual Studio does not support initialization lists in the 2010 or 2012 versions. Therefore, I recommend installing/using CMake and MinGW's g++ compiler.
